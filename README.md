# how-bitcoin-api-ingestion

Created for studying and reproduce some exercises during the [How Edu](https://howedu.com.br/) Bootcamp.

In this code we trained how to capture data requesting the public API [Mercado Bitcoin API](https://www.mercadobitcoin.com.br/api-doc/) and ingesting the captured data into a S3 Bucket.

Endpoints considered from Mercado Bitcoin API:

- Day Summary
- Trades

Here we also trained practices of programming using Python and OO.
